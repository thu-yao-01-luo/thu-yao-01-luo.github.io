I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wenguang Chen](https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~cwg/) in the [PACMAN Lab](https://github.com/thu-pacman). My research focuses on **Efficient Scaling of Large Language Models**, with particular interest in pretraining Scaling Laws, to understand and optimize the relationship between model performance and training dynamics. I am fortunate to collaborate with [Kaifeng Lyu](https://kaifeng.ac/) and [Shengding Hu](https://shengdinghu.github.io/).

<!--
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Exploring RL techniques for fine-tuning and improving large language models.

I received my **B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology** in 2024 from Tsinghua University, where I was a member of the **Yao Class**, headed by Prof. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao. During my undergraduate study, I was fortunately advised by [Li Yi](https://ericyi.github.io/), [Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/), and [Wenguang Chen](https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~cwg/).

During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of visiting the **SU Lab** at UC San Diego in Spring 2023, where I was advised by [Prof. Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/).
